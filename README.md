Javascript web application for capturing and displaying a 3D geometry representation of Coinbase's orderbook data.

Complete with animation to show changes to the orderbook mapped to time and candles.

Also contains some basic scripting for capturing and storing the orderbook data to a postgresql database on a regular interval, which can be used by the web application's API.

A more improved CLI program I wrote in GO, which has a much more improved process for capturing and grouping all of the orders from coinbase and updating the database tables accordingly.

Very much an early work in progress prototype.
