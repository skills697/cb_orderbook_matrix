Javascript web application for mapping a 3D geometry of Coinbase's orderbook data. Complete with animation to show changes to the orderbook mapped to time and candles.

Also contains some CLI scripting (within node.js) for capturing and storing the orderbook data to a postgresql database om a regular basis, which is used by the web application's API.

Very much an early work in progress prototype.
